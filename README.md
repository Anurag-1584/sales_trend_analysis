#  Sales Trend Analysis Using Python

Hello and welcome! 👋  
This project is all about analyzing sales data from a retail store to uncover trends, seasonal patterns, and useful business insights.  
I used the **Superstore dataset** (available on Kaggle) to explore things like:

- Which months have the highest sales?
- Which product categories perform best?
- How does profit vary across regions?
- Are there seasonal patterns or anomalies?

This kind of analysis helps businesses make smart decisions around marketing, stock, and operations.

## Project Objective

The goal of this project is to:
- Understand the overall **sales and profit performance** over time
- Identify **seasonal trends** or **sales peaks/slumps**
- Analyze which **categories and sub-categories** perform best
- Spot potential **anomalies** in the data

This project is a great example of how data storytelling + simple Python tools can help uncover powerful insights from business data.

##  Dataset Info

- **Dataset Name**: Superstore Sales Dataset
- **Source**: [Kaggle – Superstore Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vivek468/superstore-dataset-final)
- **Size**: ~10,000 rows
- **Key Columns**: `Order Date`, `Sales`, `Profit`, `Category`, `Sub-Category`, `Region`, `State`

---

##  Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas** – for data wrangling
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for beautiful visualizations
- **Datetime** – for working with time-based trends
- **Jupyter Notebook** – to explore and explain in one place

##  What I Did (Step-by-Step)

### 1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- Checked for missing values
- Converted `Order Date` to datetime format
- Extracted **Year**, **Month**, and **Quarter** from dates

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyzed **monthly sales trends**
- Visualized **sales vs. profit** over time
- Compared performance across **categories**, **sub-categories**, and **regions**

### 3. Visualizations
- Line plots of monthly sales and profit
- Bar plots of top-selling and most-profitable categories
- Heatmaps showing sales distribution across regions and months

### 4. Insights
- Identified seasonal peaks in sales (e.g., end-of-year spikes)
- Found high-profit but low-sales sub-categories
- Highlighted regions with consistent losses

## Key Takeaways

- 🔼 **Sales usually spike between October and December**, probably due to holiday shopping.
- 💡 **Technology** is the top-performing category in both sales and profit.
- ⚠️ Some states like **Texas and Illinois** showed high sales but low profits — which could signal high operational costs or discounts.
- 🧊 Certain sub-categories like **Tables** often led to losses.
